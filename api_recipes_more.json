Transfer the mixture to a large shallow earthenware dish, and place he lamb in the marinade, turning to evenly coat all the chunks. Marinate at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours. Remove the lamb from the marinade with a slotted spoon, reserving 1/2 cup of the marinade. In a large heavy casserole, heat the 3 tablespoons olive oil over high heat. Brown the lamb, turning with tongs to sear all sides evenly. This will take about 20 minutes (if the lamb does not fit all in one layer, brown in 2 batches, otherwise the meat will steam rather than sear). Transfer the lamb to a plate with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the jalapenos, onions, and salt. Saute, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, or until the onions are golden. Add the beer and lower the heat so that the liquid is simmering. Cook for about 15 minutes, or until all of the beer has evaporated. Return the browned lamb, along with the accumulated juices from the plate, to the pan. Add the stock and stir to mix. Bring up to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the dish, covered, for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the meat is tender. Add the potatoes, cover the pan again and cook for about 20 minutes more, or until the potatoes are tender (you may need to add a little more stock or water to keep them from scorching). Add the reserved 1/2 cup of the marinade and the cilantro, stir to mix, and cook for 1 minute more. Serve from the casserole. This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings."

    "servings": "50 Servings",
    "instructions": "Servings: Makes 50 1/2-inch empanadas Notes: Empanadas are Brazil's national appetizer, tiny pies filled with chicken olives, and peas. Belita's are famous all over Brazil. Empanadas are traditionally made in special molds that are almost as deep as they are wide. If they are unavailable, any small tartlet molds will do. \"The secret to making good dough,\" says Belita, \"is to massage it, not knead it.\" It may look as if she's making mud pies, but the results are truly superb. For the dough: To prepare the dough: Place the flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the center. Place the butter, shortening, eggs, salt, and 1 cup water in the well. Using one hand to mix, squeeze these ingredients through your fingers to make a paste. Gradually work in the flour, squeezing the dough between your fingers to mix it. Add water as necessary; the dough should be quite soft. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes while you prepare the filling. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Saute the onion and garlic over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add the chicken, bay leaf, tomato paste, salt, and pepper, plus water just to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked. Skim off the fat that rises to the surface. Remove the chicken, then strain and reserve the broth. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and remove the meat from the bone. Finely shred the meat with your fingers or in a food processor. Stir in the flour, peas, and olives. Stir in 3 to 4 Tbsp broth; the filling should be moist but not runny. Add enough cayenne to give the chicken a little bite. Pinch off cherry-sized pieces of dough and use them to line the tartlet molds. Belita pushes the dough in with her thumb. The dough should just reach over the top of the mold. Place a spoonful of filling in each crust. Roll out the remaining dough and cut out tops for the empanadas. Try to capture an air bubble when you place the top over the filling; according to Belita, this is what makes the pies light. Seal the tartlets by pinching together the top and bottom crust. Note: The empanadas can be prepared ahead to this stage and frozen. Preheat the oven to 350-F. Brush the tops with egg glaze. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Unmold and serve."

    "servings": "15 servings",
    "instructions": "Make the phyllo shells: Keep the phyllo sheets stacked between 2 sheets of wax paper, and covered with a damp towel. Brush lightly 2 baking pans at least 17 inches long with some of the butter, lay 1 sheet of the phyllo lengthwise on one of the pans, and brush it lightly with some of the remaining butter. Layer and butter 7 more sheets of phyllo over the first sheet in the same manner and roll in the edges on all 4 sides, trimming excess dough at the corners, to form a 1/2-inch-wide rim. The phyllo rectangle should measure about 15 by 7 inches. Brush the rim lightly with some of the remaining butter and prick the bottom of the shell all over with the tip of a knife. Make a second shell on the second baking pan with the 8 remaining phyllo sheets and some of the remaining butter in the same manner, reserving 2 tablespoons of the butter in a small saucepan for the filling, and bake the shells in a preheated 400 degree oven, switching their positions in the oven and pressing the centers down gently after 5 minutes, for 10 minutes, or until they are golden. The shells may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered loosely in a cool dry place. Make the filling and assemble the pizzas: Add 1 teaspoon of the garlic to the pan of reserved butter and keep the butter warm. In a skillet heat the oil over high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it saute the shrimp, stirring, for 1 minute, or until they begin to turn pink. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon garlic and saute the mixture, stirring, for 15 seconds. Add the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste and transfer the mixture to a bowl. The shrimp may be cooked 1 day in advance, kept covered and chilled, and brought to room temperature. In a food processor blend the Feta and the cream cheese until the mixture is smooth, sprinkle 1 of the phyllo shells with half the oregano, and spoon half the cheese mixture into the shell, spreading it evenly with a long metal spatula (the pastry will flake quite a bit). Top the cheese mixture with half the bell pepper, half the olives, half the tomatoes, and half the shrimp, drained, drizzle half the garlic butter over the topping, and make a second pizza with the remaining shell, oregano, cheese mixture, bell pepper, olives, tomatoes, shrimp, and garlic butter in the same manner. The pizzas may be prepared up to this point 1 hour in advance and kept covered loosely. Bake the pizzas in a preheated 400 degree oven for 10 minutes. This recipe yields 15 to 20 hors d'oeuvre servings."

Transfer to a small bowl, cover, and let stand overnight at room temperature. The next day, uncover and add 2 teaspoons orange flower water, the salt, and gradually the warm water, working with your fingers to make a firm dough. Knead for 5 minutes, then cover and let rest 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine the pistachios, sugar, and ground cinnamon in a small bowl. Break off pieces of dough slightly larger in size than a walnut. Work in your fingers to form a ball. Press the center with your thumb to make a large well and fill with 1 teaspoon of the nut mixture, then cover over with dough and shape into an oval. Set on a cookie sheet and continue until all pastries are shaped. Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to 35 minutes or until the yellow color has become a light, not a deep, chestnut. Remove to racks and cool for 10 minutes, then dip quickly into orange flower water and roll in confectioners' sugar. Cool before storing. Note: You may substitute blanched almonds for the pistachios and peanut oil for the butter."

    "title": "Mark's Version of Falafels",
    "ingredients": "2 c Chick peas|4 Garlic cloves, minced|1 sm Onion, minced|1 tb Coriander|1 1/2 tb Cumin|Several dashes tabasco|3 tb Wholewheat flour|Salt & pepper|1/4 c Parsley, minced|Stock, as needed",
    "servings": "1 Recipe",
    "instructions": "Soak chick peas, rinse well, cover with fresh water, bring to a boil & simmer until very tender. Depending on how fresh the chick peas are will determine how long this will take. Give them about 1 1/2 hours. Drain well & set aside to cool. When cool, place chick peas in food processor bowl & blend until very smooth. If you have a large enough bowl, add the rest of the ingredients, except the stock, & mix in the blender. If the bowl is not large enough, you will have to do this in batches. Then add the ingredients in order, mixing well after each addition. Add a little stock if the mixture appears too dry or looks as if it is not going to hold together very well. Cover & set aside for 30 minutes. Shape into patties. If the patties do not hold together very well, you may want to add a little more flour, but be careful, you do not want to make them too floury. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet & gently flatten. This amount should make 15 to 18 patties, so make them a reasonable size. Preheat the oven to 350F. Bake the falafel patties for 5 minutes, remove trays, flip the patties & return to the oven for another 5 minutes. Remove from trays & cool on wire racks. To serve: Heat some olive oil in a good heavy skillet, you can choose: I use 2 tb of olive oil, or you could deep fry them in a wok. If using the wok method, crumble one dried red chile into the oil as it is heating. When the oil is hot, fry the falafel patties until golden. Flip & fry the other side. Remove from the oil, drain & serve. Either serve the falafel as part of a Middle Eastern platter including some baba ganouj, hummus, tabouleh, lettuce, tomatoes, green onions & pita. Or, make up a sauce using tahini & hot sauce, warm a pita bread, slice the top off, spread the tahini paste in the pita, drop in two patties, cover with lettuce, tomatoes & green onions. Either a great snack or a main meal."
